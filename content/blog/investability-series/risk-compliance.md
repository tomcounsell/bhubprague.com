# **Assessing Your Industry**

Your diligence to watch and review the risks you face and your compliance with market regulations helps to remove stress for you and your investors. Another way to look at this is thinking, “how can we minimize the scary factor”.

Additionally, they operate in environments where hotels are districted and taxi drivers need a taxi license!

Don’t underestimate how much even the smallest amount of risk or fear can be big blockers for investors.

Also, if your business operates in a highly regulated or legal grey area (eg. transportation, food, drugs, securities, etc) you’ll need to seek out investors that have already expressed being comfortable with that industry.
