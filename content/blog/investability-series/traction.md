# **Assessing Your Traction**

Traction is the number one thing that entrepreneurs tend to lie about to investors. You will gain a lot more trust if you don’t try to fudge the numbers or sweet talk your way through using [vanity metrics](l). When talking to a serious investor, give them metrics that match with industry best practice measurements (eg. CAC/LTV or MOM gross margins).

Trying to whitewash your traction metrics will make you look like a slimy salesman and reduce your credibility across every other statement you make. This is your chance to show a potential investor that you are honest and grounded in reality. They’ve already talked to other entrepreneurs that are off in a delusional fantasy land. So don’t get labeled as one of those types!

Special note if you have been bootstrapping or running off very little funds so far:

For metrics on operational ROI, count the value of your time as starting investment capital. This works because if you expect to take a salary, then your time will be directly measured in $$ anyway and that time should be properly allocated to business activities to maximize ROI.

### **Complete the following sentences to help score your business on it’s _Quantitative Value_**

* _Our metrics on ... validate our current expenses on ... in terms of ROI._
* _Our past metrics on ... showed us ... so we shifted more focus/efforts into ..._
* _Our KPI’s right now are ... (if applicable)_

### **Note on KPI’s**

Use KPI’s for departments in your company (eg. IT, sales) with 3 or more people. A good start is 1 internal KPI (eg. widgets shipped, sales leads contacted) and 1 external KPI (eg. CAC/LTV, active users)
