Much has happened since 2017 when we started Blockchain Hub. We have always believed in the power of partnerships and the urge to cooperate has never been more essential for success than at times like these.

Community-driven support, shared resources, and experience are the most valuable assets an entrepreneur. That is why we are opening up memberships to _any internet startup_, founder, investor or partner, who wants to take part in our vision of mutual success. That means, there is no limitation to blockchain projects.
