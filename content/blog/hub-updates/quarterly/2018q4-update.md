# Blockchain Hub Prague

### 2018Q4 Update

***

The last quarter of 2018 was very exciting in Blockchain Hub  Prague! New members joined our community, we created important partnerships along the way, and even managed to give a little back by joining charity efforts of a non-governmental organisation. Blockchain Hub is growing, maturing and becoming a place people talk about.

We reorganised our space again, this time, with help of a new Blockchain Hub’s full-time employee, **Kristýna Břízová**, who joined BH as a new   Office Admin at the end of October. Kristýna has experience from diverse job opportunities, one of them also being at Google. We trust that she will be the right person to support our office and help us keep it a great place to work from.

**Crowdholding** hired new forces as well. **Lorenzo Ferrario** has joined to   help shape content and campaigns in the business development role. He’s also adept at coming up with ingenious hacks to push other aspects of the business forward wherever needed. With considerable experience in corporate finance and product management, **Rygor Zidkov,** is setting up Crowdholding with a solid approach to the financial side of the company.

In November we welcomed **Aerum**, another blockchain startup, in our office. **Alex Randarevich**, CEO, and his teammates **Patrick O’Sullivan** and **Daniel Baznamin** are now regular Blockchain Hub members! Aerum is planning to disrupt the FinTech industry, by introducing free, real-time transactions, highly scalable smart contract protocol, optimized for tokenization and trustless financial operations.

Next November highlight was partnering up with a Prague based NGO, **Dignity Restoring Hope,** and supporting their efforts to help refugees placed in Czech integration centres. We organised winter clothes collection and with financial contribution from Blockchain Hub, we managed to put together Christmas packages for the refugees’ children. **Tom** and **Petra Damms** and their organisation are now another great part of our community and we are planning to continue supporting them. Big thanks to everyone who took part and helped us to give a little back!

### Blockchain Hub Events

We held several trading meetups for **Intelligent Trading Foundation** including a  highly technical presentation on Trading with AI Using Genetic Programming. Blockchain Hub team has extensive plans for meet-ups and  both educational and networking events, so hopefully you will hear from us a lot more in 2019!

At the end of October we hosted one more interesting event for **MBA Students from Ashland University** in collaboration with International Study Programs. All startups participated and provided information about their projects. There was also a subsequent workshop, where the students cooperated with the startups, helping them solve presented issues. In the afternoon program, Tadhg Riordan represented Blockchain Hub in a  cybersecurity oriented panel discussion. We are very proud we could be part of the event!

We have closed the year with two major events. One of them was **Christmas Party**, an informal get-together which was held on St. Nicholas Day for all Blockchain Hub members. Besides eating, drinking, and celebrating, Tom Damms came to tell us some more about their refugee help. Blockchain Hub decided to distribute money which could be given back for Christmas  packages for children of refugees in Kostelec nad Orlicí integration centre. Big thanks to everyone who decided to give back, and last but not least, to all the girls helping out with the preparations!

Last event was **Blockchain Hub’s Startup Showcase**, a networking event held on December 17th in Kasárna Karlín. Tom Counsell and Ethan Clime spoke about their visions and plans, and our startups shared their most important updates. We very much enjoyed seeing our community, our  advisors and partners all together.  It has been a year of growth for Blockchain Hub and this event only illustrated this fact.

### Big Thanks

* We wish to thank everyone who has been helpful and instrumental on our journey through 2018, mainly to our startups who are the basis of our great community, but also to our partners, contractors, and advisors. Let’s hope  that our community only grows in the future and continues to provide benefits to everyone involved!
* Special thanks go to **Ryan Viguerie**, our friend, who donated his personal collection of books to Blockchain Hub Shared Library for free! ( [https://trello.com/b/2BNIMgwh](https://trello.com/b/2BNIMgwh) )
