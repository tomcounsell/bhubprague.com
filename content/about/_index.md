\# Andrea's notes

Focus on education, personal/entrepreneurial development & growth, innovative projects, entrepreneurship/development of ideas, (original model of incubation becomes an alternative option for successful projects and people we are interested in keeping)

\- **Incubation for Founders and Small Teams** 

 - Our Projects - for free until funded

 - External projects with potential that we like and want to support - fees comparable to renting a flat to work from

 - People with the grit and potential who are seeking community of like-minded hard-working,driven people - individual programs

\-  **Traineeships and Internships**

 - Is it possible to partner up with the agencies providing internships,traineeships and exchange programs and get paid for that?

 - Potential benefits for us : we get to keep our projects slowly growing with less cost - plus we get to try the people and can partner up with the exceptional ones,engage with young people and pull them in our world, build “one-of-us” community across borders and promote our projects through the programs,chance to get support from EU and locally - apply for grants!,partnership with local/international universities, getting the right visibility and trust

 - give chance to young entrepreneurs to work on their thing during their stay with us - Premium program - pay extra and get more specific mentoring,etc.,
